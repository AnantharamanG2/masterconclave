									<h2>Happiness Index</h2>
									<p>Any education that treat all students the same way is the most crude form of education. Each kid out there is unique in their own way, but the standardised tests and time table focusing too much on logical-mathematical and linguistical ends up in making other "differently-abled" kids or simply under-achievers. Their happiness index and purpose of schooling shifts gradually from learning to survival. This is one of the main reasons why kids have inhibition developed to schools. Happiness in directly proportional to their learning.</p>

									<h2>Drop-out Ratio</h2>
									<p>It is a well known fact that most of the rennowned thinkers and modern day entrepreneurs are school/college drop out, in other words inability to address and cater to their highly unique way of thinking makes them to drop from the system. More than a myth, drop our ratios from school college is a very alarming fact followed by the social stigma they have to go through. This is a collective loss to the system as well as individual. Primary reason for this inspite of other material world reason is the lack of curiosity it offers to the individual.</p>

									<h2>Work-Life Equillibrium</h2>
									<p>India is a country well know for its brain health and ignited minds, which over the years have been utilised to the maximum by the west and their projects.Moving away from the creamy layer, India is also a country that works round the clock as one of the key out-sourcing hubs for the world because of cheap labour and HR availability. Most of the corporates, organizations face an acute shortage of inspired employees and volunteers because of this highly competative and uneven filtering system.Since, their "performance" is being continuously regulated by just a common yardstick, they are taught to adapt well to an intelligence out of their natural zone, which is fine but takes a substantially longer amount of time and which can be easily burnt out,  </p>

							<h2>What we do</h2>
							<p>The <a href="http://multipleintelligencesoasis.org/">THEORY OF MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCE</a>is interpreted to be the validation of the concept all of us are unique, what the theory says in, "There has to be a grassroot change in the way education is perceived, it should move from a competative-compelling atmosphere to a natural environment, where the kids play a major part in driving the knowledge base to themselves based on their cognitive and natural intelligence at their pace". The need to bridge the theory with our specific "KERALA/INDIAN" context using technology to overcome some of the human dependency and highly insightful data models as backbone is what we do.</p>
